# TVshows
I was working on dataset from kaggle which is about tv series on 4 different platforms(Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney).
I cleaned the data and  tried to examine the data with some visualizations. 
The most interesting information to me, getting higher scores from IMDb is getting harder over the years.
The other interesting information is that getting a high score from IMDb is more difficult than getting a high score from Rotten Tomatoes. 
In addition, the series published on Netflix are more likely to be broadcast on other platforms than others. 
You can see my visualizations, I am still working on them and trying to improve. 
I wish everyone Health and Happy week!
